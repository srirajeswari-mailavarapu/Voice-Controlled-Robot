## 📖 Abstract

This project aims to design a **voice-controlled robot** using an Android app, Arduino Uno, and Bluetooth module. The robot responds to voice commands such as forward, backward, left, right, and stop. The system is designed to assist in **medical and inaccessible environments**, offering hands-free operation through simple voice input.
